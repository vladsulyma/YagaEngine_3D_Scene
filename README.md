# YagaEngine_3D_Scene
This project features an interactive 3D scene of Baba Yaga's hut, built with React, Three.js, and Framer Motion. Users can navigate between camera points, interact with hotspots, and view additional information through overlays. The project demonstrates 3D model integration, lighting effects, and animations in a web environment.
